======================================
General Purpose
======================================

Proper IDisposable Implementation
All IDisposable objects are disposed or returned from method.
Disposable objects as non-private property/field types are dangerous.
return await Task.FromResult(...).
Task.WaitAll(), .Result, .Wait(), etc in async method
Equals & GetHashCode operates on different fields/properties
Improper null checks in ==/!= operator overloads
Check for license header at top of file

======================================
iSynaptic Specific
======================================
Only on methods should mutate state
Init logic should happen in initialize method
On methods should only mutate local state and not call command methods
Aggregates should not exposes state publically
Partial ValueObjects should not add additional fields outside of generated ones
Partial scalar values should only have one field
